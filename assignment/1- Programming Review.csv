"I ranked the jobs with what I hope to do after I graduate. I took into account pay, workload, and location. Data scientist and lawyer were my top 2 because they had a high pay and were highly based in DC.",,,,,,,,,,
"I wasn't very surprised about the facts of these occupations. They were about what I expected them to be. However, I thought lawyer's median income would be higher. ",,,,,,,,,,
